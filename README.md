# Magento 2 Quick View Extension

## Introduction
Allows your site's visitor to quickly view product details and add products to cart right from the popup window on a category page. Enhance user experience by reducing the complexity of 'add to cart' progress.


There are some of the **QuickView extensions** out there already **why build this**? 

1. I am a Magento developer but in most of my time is working with the Magento 1.9.X version. So first reason is to grow my experiences in Magento 2 development.

2. The extensions as I found online they usually built the extension for building brand image. So there will advertisements and they might not that care the customers who do not pay them.

3. Having an own version so easier to maintain and extend.
